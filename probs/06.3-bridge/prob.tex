A Twin-Leaf Bascule bridge is a bridge where the two leafs (sections) of the bridge can rotate upwards to let
the height clearance below the bridge to increase to allow ships to pass below. Consider a parabolic Twin Leaf
Bascule bridge as shown below. Assume that in a closed position, the joint between the two leafs is a hinge
joint. The axis of the three-hinge arch ABC is a parabola with the vertex at B. Knowing that $P = 700$ kN and
$Q = 560$ kN, determine:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The components of the reaction at A.
  \item The components of the force exerted at B on segment AB.
\end{itemize}
