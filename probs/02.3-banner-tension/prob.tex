The figure below shows a banner hanging on campus along with an idealized diagram for this banner. The banner has length $L = 7.5m$, height $H = 1.5m$, and mass $m = 5kg$. Assume:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the cables directions are as shown with $\tan(\phi) = \frac{H}{L}$
  \item the tension in cable A is twice that of cable C
  \item the tension in cable B is twice that of cable D
\end{enumerate}
Given these assumptions estimate the tension in each cable so that there is zero net force on the banner.
