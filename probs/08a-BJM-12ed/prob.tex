\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[8.48] (a) 283 N to left, (b) $B_x = 413 N$ to left, (c) $B_y = 480 N$ down
  \item[8.56] (a) $28.1^\circ$, (b) 728 N at $14.04^\circ$ up and to the right from the horizontal
  \item[8.15] For impending tipping, the reaction is at C.  And being a 3-force body, the reaction must pass through the intersection of $P$ and $W$. (a) $\mu_s = 0.485$ (found by solving for $\phi_s$) (b) $P = 255 N$
