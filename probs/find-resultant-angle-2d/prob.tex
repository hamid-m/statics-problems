A skid-steer loader breaks down at a job site.  Two tow ropes are attached pulling along $AB$ and $AC$.  The tension in rope $AB$ is $3 kN$.  The goal is to pull along $AC$ such that a $4.8-kN$ force is applied horizontally at point $A$, thereby pulling the skid-steer loader safely away from the job site.

Determine the tension and direction ($\alpha$) required to pull along $AC$ to achieve this.
