A composite solid consists of a rectangular block of lightweight concrete and a triangular wedge of steel with dimensions as shown. The rectangular block has a $2 ft$ radius circular hole, centered and drilled through its full depth, perpendicular to the front and back faces.

Assume:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\gamma_C = 125 lb/ft^3$
  \item $\gamma_S = 493 lb/ft^3$
\end{itemize}
