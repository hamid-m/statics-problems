The space shuttle is headed in a direction that is $80^\circ$ relative to horizontal and $45^\circ$ west of north. The rocket thrust acts opposite the direction of travel of the space shuttle. Assume that the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinate axes are directed east, up, and south, respectively. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw the space shuttle and the assumed coordinate system.
  \item Determine the $x$, $y$, and $z$-components of the thrust force.
\end{enumerate}
