Professor Seiler is trying his hand at rappelling. He has chosen a cliff (AOB) which is inclined to the vertical as shown in the figure. It is known that $\theta = 80$ degrees and $\beta = 65$ degrees. It is also know that Professor Seiler weighs $750$ N. His CG is located at $162$ cm from his feet and he is holding the rope with his hands which are at a distance of $180$ cm from his feet as shown on the right. Let the coefficient of friction between his feet and the cliff wall be $\mu_s$.

Find:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tension in the rope.
  \item The minimum value of $\mu_s$ so that he does not slip and remains in equilibrium.
\end{enumerate}
