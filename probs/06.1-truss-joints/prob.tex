While constructing the new recreational-center building, the construction company erected a temporary plat-
form as shown in the figure. The equipment kept on the platform at point B weighs 693 lb. The platform can
be modeled as a truss. Using the method of joints, determine the force in each member of the truss shown.
State whether each member is in tension or compression.
