\noindent While constructing the new recreational-center building, the construction company erected a temporary platform as shown in the figure. The equipment kept on the platform at point B weighs 693 lb. The platform can be modeled as a truss. 

\noindent Use the \textbf{method of sections} to determine the force in member AB.  State whether the member is in tension or compression. \textit{(Clearly indicate the cut/section and draw the FBD of the portion under analysis.)}
