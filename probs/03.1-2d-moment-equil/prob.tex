An L-shaped bracket is supported by a frictionless pin at $A$ and a cable between points $B$ and $D$.  Determine the tension in the cable required for equilibrium when a $70 N$ force $\bar{F}$ is applied to the bracket as shown at point $C$. 


\textit{Tip: Since the object is in equilibrium $\sum M_A = 0$ implies that the opposing moments must have equal magnitudes.}
